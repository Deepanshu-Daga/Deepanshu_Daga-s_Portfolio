## [Project 1 : STOCK TREND (NEXT 60 DAYS PRICE) PREDICTION APP (click me) ](https://github.com/Deepanshu-Daga/STOCK-TREND-NEXT-60-DAYS-PRICE-PREDICTION-APP-)

[FOR VIDEO EXPLANATIION OF APP (click me) ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N2ct9_HJ4eciI9y803GR8qxqW2cktKIA/view?usp=sharing)

A app which can predict the stoct price movment of all Stocks included in National (Nifty / Sensex ) and International stocks Exchnage ( DOW ).

Its prediction model is build on a DEEP LEARNING RNN MODEL .

For each stock it goes through undermentioned steps :

collecting data via pandas.

Data cleaning.

Deviding train and test data.

Training a deep learning RNN model for each stock on its train data set.

Checking accuracy for each model on its test data set.

Finally automating the model creation process for any listed stock name.

Creating a training data set to train our deep learning model on it.

Model training period : 26 hours

Using YOLOv5 Architecture for the object detection.





## [Project 3 : DEEP LEARNING FACE RECOGNITION AND CUSTOM OBJECT TRACKING (click me) ]()


Project Workflow -- Python programmed Image Dataset creation--Bounding Boxes (Annotation) -- Train-Test Set Distribution -- Model training -- Live Video Face Detection

Deep Learning Model training period : 30 hours

Using State of the art YOLOv5 Architecture 






## [Project 4 : POWER-BI-REVENUE-SALES-ANALYSIS (click me) ](https://github.com/Deepanshu-Daga/Power-BI-Revenue---Sales---Analysis-)
A detailed Power BI interactive and interlinked field dashboard. Data set is linked along with POWER BI Dashboard to get insight of type of product in which region , country , city and a lot more parameters. A set with 51000+ record entries. To enhance the user experience it can be created adaptable to mobile interface with limited use acessability.
